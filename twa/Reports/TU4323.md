# Trend Report - Activity Counts Weekly

User Story: I can find out how many Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings there are per week and review change over time. 

This report tells me

- How much each modality is being used 
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement by week, indicating behavioural change. 

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced WoW change, such as an decrease in activity from a particular office, or increased engagement at 'Very High' level. 

Trend lines can be compared with Weekly Active Users to understand periods of high activity within the User base, and filtered to Country, City, Department or Location for deeper analysis.
