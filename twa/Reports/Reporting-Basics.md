The database holds:
- Daily per user activity for up to 14 days of the data we have (e.g. on the 27th, we may only have data until 25th, so you can visualise to the 11th
- Weekly is held for a year - weeks begin Monday
- Monthly activities summaries for infinate months (subject to storage) 
e.g. I can filter on a custom AD field for monthly usage for all time

Yearly for infinate years subject to storage (subject to storage)

Reprorts are either day report or month reports, you can't mix and match in a signle report

"users" will always include any guests in totals

where used, members, owners and guests are explicit

# In development/aspirational

We will only show a month in a month date picker, if we have complete information for that month
