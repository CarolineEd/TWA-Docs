# Avg Use per User per Day by Country

User Story: I can find out the average number of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per User over the last 14 days. 

This report tells me

- The average usage level per modality, by Country  
- Which is the most used activity type, and how it differs between countries
- How the proportion of one modality to another differs between countries 

Drill through to see which each Country's Users, locations and attributes. Analyse distribution to find out which level of Users contributes most to the activity (Very High, High, Medium or Low activity).
