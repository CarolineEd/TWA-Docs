# Trend Report - Weekly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how weekly usage levels differ by activity type, over time. 

With weekly data, activity mix can reviewed for trends and seasonality.   

This report tells me

- How many Users are collaborating per modality
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement for each activity type

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced change, such as a decrease in activity from specific departments or an increase in 'Very High Activity' Users.
