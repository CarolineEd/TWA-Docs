# Team Creation and Status

User Story: I can find out how many new teams have been created over time, by whom and where.  

This report tells me

- How many teams have been created in total; drill down or expand to view per month and date
- How active those teams are (Messages in last 30 days)
- Team visibility (Public/Private/Hidden) and archive status
- Where team Owners are located (Department, City and Country)
