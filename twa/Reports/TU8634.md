# Weekly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how engagement differs between types of activity, on a weekly basis. 

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me

- Which Users might need help or training 
- The effect of seasonality on levels of activity (more users in High/Very High during holiday periods?)
- Who the most engaged Users are, and where (Champions)
- How many Users are actively engaging with Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls and Meetings
