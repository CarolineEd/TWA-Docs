# Month on Month

User Story: I can find out how the number of Users and modality actions has changed month on month, in both tabular and graphical format.

This report tells me

- Percentage increase/decrease per month for User numbers and modality actions
- The overall amount of change per month across all modalities and Users, displaying which elements have increased/decreased the most
- Which Countries/modalities/Departments have changed the most from month to month

Analyse Month on Month Change to understand the key drivers behind the percentages e.g. which Department's Teams Messages performance has most affected the overall % increase.
