# Activity by Country and Modality

User Story: I can find out the % of active Users per Country for all modalities, individually and in total. 

This report tells me

- The % of Users who are using Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls and Meetings
- How the active % differs by modality, to understand the behavioural mix
- How much Chat Messages are used vs Team Messages, from one Country to another

Drill through to see which each Country's Users, locations and attributes.
