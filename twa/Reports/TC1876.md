# User Collaboration Activity

User Story: I can find out about per-User collaboration by the number of teams joined, owned and is a member or guest of. 

This report tells me

- Distribution of teams joined
- Each active User's team status 

Summary information updates dynamically as location filters are applied (Country, City, Department, Office), and shows the minimum, maximum and average number of teams joined and owned.
