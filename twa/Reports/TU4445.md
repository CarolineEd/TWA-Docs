# Active User Percentages

User Story: I can find out the percentage split of Users by Country and Department per one of four activity thresholds, per modality.

This report tells me

- The percentage of 'Very High' Users of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per Country and Department
- How well represented a Country's Users are in each activity threshold
- The percentage split by Department of Chat vs Team Messages at 'Medium' activity level

Drill through to see which each Users fall into each Country/Department's activity threshold for Chat or Team Messages, Calls and Meetings.
