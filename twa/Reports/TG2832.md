# Team Files

User Story: I can find details of files in teams by type, size and last modified date. 

This report tells me: 

- How many files in teams per file type (including email message, text file, PNG, PDF)
- The number of teams by file count (banded 1-50, 51-100, 101-500, 501-1000, >1000)
- Details of files, per team

The view can be filtered by last modified date, visibility and whether or not a team has Guests.
