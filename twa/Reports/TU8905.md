# Trend Report - Activity Counts Daily

User Story: I can find out how many Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings there are per day, including over weekends. 

This report tells me

- How much each modality is being used 
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement by days of the week for each activity type

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced daily change, such as an increase in Users, or a drop in activity from a particular country.

Trend lines can be compared with Daily Active Users to understand periods of high activity within the User base, and filtered to Country, City, Department or Location for deeper analysis.
