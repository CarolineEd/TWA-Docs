# Trend Report - Per User Activity Weekly

User Story: I can find out the moving average number of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per User, per week over the last 12 weeks. 

This report tells me

- How the level of activity fluctuates over time
- The mix of User activity, and whether patterns correlate between modalities

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced WoW change, and filter data by Country, City, Department and Office for deeper understanding of patterns and behaviour at a User level.
