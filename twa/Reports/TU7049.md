# Trend Report - Monthly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how usage levels differ by activity type, over a long period time. 

This report tells me

- How many Users are collaborating per modality
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement by days of the week for each activity type

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced MoM change, such as an increase in Users, or a drop in activity from a particular country.
