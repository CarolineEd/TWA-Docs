# Trend Report - Daily Active Users

User Story: I can find out how daily usage levels differ by activity type, over time. 

With daily data, activity mix per day of the week can reviewed, including weekend working.  

This report tells me

- How many Users are collaborating per modality
- Whether there's a pattern of engagement by days of the week for each activity type

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced daily change, such as an increase in activity from specific departments or an increase in 'Low Activity' Users.
