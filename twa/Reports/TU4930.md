# Trend Report - Per User Activity Monthly

User Story: I can find out the monthly moving average number of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per User, per week over the last 6 months. 

This report tells me

- The affect of seasonality on average User activity, per modality
- The mix of User activity, and whether patterns are emerging between and within modalities

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced MoM change, and filter data by Country, City, Department and Office for deeper understanding of patterns and behaviour at a User level.
