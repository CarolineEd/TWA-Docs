# Teams Distribution

User Story: I can find out the number and % of teams by Channels and Owners, and view the full team listing. 

This report tells me

- Total teams by number of Owners and Channels
- Number of Owners and Channels per team
- Percentage of teams by number of Owners and Channels

Drill through from team name to see Files and Guests, Users and Attributes including Custom AD Attributes. All graphs in this report are filterable by Visibility (Public/Private/Hidden) and location (Country, City, Department, Office).
