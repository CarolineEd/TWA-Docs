# Active User Counts

User Story: I can find out the number of Users in each Country and Department who fall into each one of four activity thresholds, per modality.

This report tells me

- The number of 'Very High' Users of Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings per Country and Department
- How well represented a Country's Users are in each activity threshold
- The numeric split by Department of e.g. Chat vs Team Messages at 'Medium' activity level

Summary information changes dynamically as activity thresholds are changed, and filters applied. Drill through to see which each Users fall into each Country/Department's activity threshold for Chat or Team Messages, Calls and Meetings.
