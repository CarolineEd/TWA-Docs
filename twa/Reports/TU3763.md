# Trend Report - Activity Counts Monthly

User Story: I can find out how many Chat and Team Messages, Calls and Meetings there are per month and review change over time.

This report tells me

- How much each modality is being used 
- Whether there's an emerging pattern of engagement with monthly moving actuals per activity type, indicating behavioural change

Each trend line can be analysed to show which factor(s) most influenced MoM change, such as an decrease in activity from a particular office, or increased engagement at 'Very High' level. 

Trend lines can be compared with Monthly Active Users to understand periods of low or high activity within the User base, and filtered to Country, City, Department or Location for deeper analysis.
