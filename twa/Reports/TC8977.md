# Team Stats

User Story: I can find out about team ownership, membership and activity status. 

This report tells me

- Total teams by number of Members
- Team Visibility (Public/Private/Hidden) and archive status
- How many Owners, Guests and Members are in each team
- Number of Channels in a team

Drill through from team name to see Files and Guests, Users and Attributes including Custom AD Attributes.
