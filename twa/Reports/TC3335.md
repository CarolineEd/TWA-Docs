# Users and Attributes

User Story: I can view all users and find out who is in which team, where they're located and any Custom Attributes they may have. 

This report tells me

- Who every User is, and where they're based (Country, City, Department)
- Which domain each user is from
- Custom Attributes per User

Drill through to see which teams a User is a member of, and how many Channels and Owners each of those teams has.
