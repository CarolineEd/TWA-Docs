# Monthly Active Users

User Story: I can find out how engagement differs between types of activity, on a monthly basis. 

At monthly level, User activity trends and seasonality are easy to spot. 

This report uses colour-coded activity thresholds to tell me

- Whether low activity is an ongoing problem for a particular department or office (poor adoption)
- How activity thresholds differ between User groups 
- How many Users are actively engaging with Chat Messages, Team Messages, Calls and Meetings
- Which modality has the highest levels of User activity
- Whether engagement is increasing or decreasing over time, and which Users are driving the most change
