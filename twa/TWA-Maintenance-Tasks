# Azure VM/Database

- Ensure VM is running 24x7
- VM Resources - We recommend no resource reduction to be made on VM from initial deployment. If reduction is made, please review PowerBI Apps/Reports to ensure data is still process as expected.
- Network and/or Security Group changes - If any changes are made, please review PowerBI Apps/Reports to ensure data is still process as expected.
- VM Backup - Backup is not essential as the service can be quickly redeployed and data re-pulled from your tenant. However, if you feel the data has significant value and re-deployment would be detrimental to your project, please back the VM and Database.
