# Modality Yammer Usage

Thank you for installing the Modality Yammer Usage Power BI app. 

> This application reports on information from the Modality Teamwork Analytics data engine. 
It comes pre-installed with demo data, allowing you to navigate the app and explore how the 
app visualises Yammer information to improve user adoption and enhance corporate social efforts.
If you have already have Teamwork Analytics deployed, follow the deployment instructions to connect these reports to your data. If, after reviewing the demo, you wish to proceed to purchase Teamwork Analytics for use with your own data, or deploy a trial in your tenant please [contact us](https://modalitysoftware.com/contact) for further details.

## Things to try

### Filtering

You can filter information using the top bar. For instance, on the *Summary* page, try changing the *Country* dropdown to *Australia*. All other visuals on the page will change to now only show information about Yammer related to users with their country set to Australia.

### Visual Filtering

You can also click on visuals to set filters. Try clicking the *Top Departments by Posted Messages in the last 30 days* ring to only show *Consulting(UK)*. The list of users and locations will now only show Yammer usage for that specific department.

### Insights
When looking at graphs, you can also use insights to attempt to explain changes. Right-click on a point in a graph, choose *Analyze > Explain*:
